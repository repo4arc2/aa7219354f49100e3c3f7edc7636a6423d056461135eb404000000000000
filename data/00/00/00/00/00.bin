00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,410
山姆舅舅
Uncle Sam!

12
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,160
山姆  我一定要把船卖掉
Sam, the boat's gotta go.

13
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,750
我已经竭尽所能去维持生意了
I'm doin' everything I can to keep this business afloat.

14
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,830
但是我们每天入不敷出
And every day I'm making $5, and spending $10.

15
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,120
那面盾牌是一个逝去时代的纪念碑
That shield is a monument to a bygone era.

16
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,080
让人们记住历史上被遗忘的那些人
A reminder of all the people history just left out.

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,080
其实那面盾牌应该被毁掉
If anything, that shield should be destroyed.

18
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,870
我听说了索科威亚的命运
I heard what became of Sokovia.

19
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,080
你俩应该都懒得去看纪念碑吧
I don't suppose any of you bothered visiting the memorial?

20
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,370
当然
Of course not.

21
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,160
所以你是说  几十年前有个黑人超级士兵
So you're telling me that there was a black Super Soldier

22
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,000
但是却没人知道
decades ago and nobody knew about it?

23
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,160
你知道他们是怎么对待我的吗
You know what they did to me?

24
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,370
他们把我关进监狱30年
They put my ass in jail for 30 years.

25
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,790
你为什么放弃了盾牌
Why'd you give up that shield?

26
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,660
你能不能接受  我做了我认为正确的选择
Can you accept that I did what I thought was right?

27
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,580
卡莉·摩根索  你被捕了
Karli Morgenthau, you're under arrest.

28
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,200
-原来这才是你的目的  -不  等等
- This is what that was? - No, wait...

29
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,580
-骗我  等增援  -聊得够久了
- Tricking me until help came? - We've spoken enough.

30
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,790
-纳粹  -你给我...
- You Nazi. - Why don't you...

31
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,250
如果你有机会注射血清  你会接受吗
If you had the chance to take the serum, would you?

32
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
当然
Hells, yeah.

33
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,120
你不担心血清会改变你吗
You wouldn't worry about it changing you?

34
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,040
能力只会放大一个人的本性  对吗
Power just makes a person more of themselves, right?

35
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,410
莱玛
Hey, Lemar.

36
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,290
莱玛  莱玛  莱玛
Lemar. Lemar. Lemar.

37
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,750
不是我干的
It wasn't me!

38
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,620
不是我干的
It wasn't me!

39
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,920
不是我干的
Wasn't me!

40
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,860
你跟我说
You told me.

41
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,970
你不希望我去
You didn't want me to go in.

42
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,110
-我怎么就没听  -你没事吧
- Why didn't I listen? - You all right, man?

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,120
这身衣服  是满载着期待的  兄弟
This suit, it comes with expectations, brother.

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,740
为什么
Why?

45
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,390
我知道你想抓到她  我理解
Look, John, I know you want this. I get it.

46
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,630
你始终能在激战中做出正确决定
You consistently make the right decisions in the heat of battle.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,750
该去工作了
Time to go to work.

48
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,910
该去工作了
Time to go to work.

49
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,090
沃克...
Walker...

50
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,600
你们该检查一下  你们看上去不太好
You guys should see a medic, you don't look so good.

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,810
站住  沃克
Stop, Walker.

52
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,000
干吗
What?

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,350
你看到事情经过了  你清楚我必须做什么
You saw what happened. You know what I had to do.

54
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,450
我杀他是因为我必须杀他  他杀了莱玛
I killed him because I had to! He killed Lemar!

55
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,220
他没杀莱玛  约翰
He didn't kill Lemar, John.

56
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,780
别走上那条路  相信我  结局不会好的
Don't go down that road. Believe me, it doesn't end well.

57
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,290
我不像你
I'm not like you.

58
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,830
听着  那是发生在激战之中
Listen, it was the heat of the battle. Okay?

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,750
如果你说清楚到底怎么回事
If you explain what happened, 

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,410
他们可能会顾念你的过往
they may consider your record.

61
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,960
我们不希望再有人受伤了
We don't want anyone else to get hurt.

62
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,000
约翰
John...

63
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,210
你得把盾给我
You gotta give me the shield, man.

64
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,540
原来是为了这个吗
So that's what this is.

65
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,750
你差点唬住我了
You almost got me.

66
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,240
你犯了错
You made a mistake.

67
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,370
你们最好别这么干
You don't wanna do this.

68
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,090
我们必须干
Yeah, we do.

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,360
你为什么这么逼我
Why are you making me do this?

70
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,110
你为什么这么逼我
Why are you making me do this?

71
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,850
你不是这种人  约翰
This isn't you, John.

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,350
我们本可以组成个团队
We could've been a team.

73
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,440
我是美国队长
I am Captain America!

74
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,860
不
No!

75
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,940
它是我的
It's mine.

76
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,080
结束了  约翰
It's over, John.

77
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,320

全球回归委员会在进行突袭  以期找到卡莉
The GRC is conducting raids to try and find Karli,

80
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,010
但目前他们只找到了她的追随者
but so far they've only found her followers.

81
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,960
他们搜了这片营地
They've searched this camp,

82
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,800
跟在上个营地一样  毫无发现
and just like the last camp, nothing.

83
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,360
她消失了  我们别想找到她了
She's gone. We'll never find her.

84
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,020
你拿回袖子了
Hey, you got your sleeve back.

85
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
你是要去解决泽莫吗
Are you off to take care of Zemo?

86
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,480
好  很高兴你活下来了
All right, good to know you survived.

87
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,060
我们接下来怎么办  托里斯
What's our next steps, Torres?

88
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,760
美国队长当众杀死一名外国人
Captain America killing a foreign national in public,

89
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,300
这可是件大事
it's kinda like a big deal.

90
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,690
国际大事件
Like international incident big.

91
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,970
高层
Folks, uh, higher up on the payroll 

92
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,920
现在已在全力处理了  很遗憾
are all over it now. So, unfortunately...

93
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,720
他们要接手
They're taking jurisdiction.

94
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,890
对
Yeah.

95
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,300
这是怎么了
What happened to these?

96
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,280
-我们能做什么吗  -并不能
- So is there anything we can do? - Not really.

97
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,310
你可以看到  他们封了整个营地
As you can see, they've cordoned off the whole camp, 

98
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,910
卡莉又神出鬼没
and Karli's a ghost.

99
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,950
在发生了那么多事后  她格外隐秘
After what went down, she is laying extra low.

100
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,940
藏得很深
Like, under-underground.

101
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,220
所以我们更该插手
And that's why it makes sense for us to get involved.

102
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,670
我们给她重新组队的时间越久
The longer we let her regroup,

103
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,430
再想找到她就越难
the harder it's gonna be to find her.

104
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,760
全世界都有人在帮她
She's got people helping her from all over the world, 

105
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,220
所有平台上都有
on all platforms.

106
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,690
她真的很擅长这个
She's really, really good at this thing.

107
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,490
是啊
Yeah.

108
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,530
这怎么坏的
How'd these break?

109
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,280
反正  我们现在只能坐等着了
Anyway, all we can do now is sit tight and just chill.

110
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,970
有时  就是无事可做直到有事可做
Sometimes, there's nothing to do until there's something to do.

111
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,950
真是睿智得奇怪
That's bizarrely wise.

112
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,090
-我是个睿智得奇怪的人  山姆  -得了吧
- Well, I'm a bizarrely wise man, Sam. - Yeah, all right.

113
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,730
-谢谢  托里斯  -不客气
- Thanks, Torres. - For sure.

114
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,150
等等  你落了翅膀
Wait, yo, you forgot the wings.

115
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,590
留着吧
Keep 'em.

116
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,690
约翰·F·沃克  本理事会下令
John F. Walker, it is the order of this council

117
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,370
你不得再以任何形式
that you are no longer to act in any capacity

118
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,610
代表美国或美国军队
as a representative of the united States government or its military.

119
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,330
你自此被剥夺美国队长的
You are hereby stripped of your title 

120
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,370
头衔和权威
and authority as Captain America,

121
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,280
即刻生效
effective immediately.

122
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,470
参议员  请求向理事会提交关于
Senator, uh, permission to present to the council testimony

123
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,740
事发情况的证词
as to the circumstances of the incident.

124
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,630
事发情况已被考虑在内
Circumstances of the incident have been considered.

125
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,350
完全是因为
It's only because of 

126
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,180
你此前曾为本国尽忠职守
your previous exemplary service to this country

127
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,670
我才推荐不送你上军事法庭
that I'm recommending against a court-martial.

128
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,500
恕我直言  参议员
With all due respect, Senator,

129
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,540
我认为您并不理解当时的情况多严重
I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation fully,

130
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,360
因此误解了当时的情况...
thereby, have misunderstood the circumstances...

131
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,730
-这不是谈判  -我知道
- This is not a negotiation. - I understand that.

132
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,430
-这是强制命令  -我只想有发声的机会
- This is a mandate. - I'm just asking to be heard.

133
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,720
这是强制命令
It is a mandate.

134
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,840
我明白  我明白
I understand that! I understand that!

135
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,920
我这辈子都在遵守你们的命令
I lived my life by your mandates!

136
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,970
我把人生献给了你们的命令

138
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,680
做你们要我做的人  训练我做的事  我都做了
what you told me to be and trained me to do, and I did it.

139
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,820
还做得很好
And I did it well.

140
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,750
你将非光荣退役
You will be given an other than honorable discharge

141
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,520
回溯到本月初
retroactive to the beginning of the month.

142
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,900
你退休后将失去军衔  得不到补贴
You will hold no rank in retirement and receive no benefits.

143
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,300
你们塑造了我
You built me.

144
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,790
参议员  我就是美国队长
Senator, I am Captain America.

145
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,350
今后不是了
Not anymore.

146
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,360
如果你还继续贬低诋毁
And if you continue to demean and denigrate

147
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,070
本理事会的目标和尊严
the priorities and dignity of this council,

148
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,570
你余生
you will spend the rest of your life 

149
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,080
将在美国军人惩戒所度过
in the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks.

150
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,420
你该感到庆幸  沃克先生
Consider yourself extremely fortunate, Mr. Walker,

151
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,530
并尽快归还盾牌
and return the shield to us with expedience.

152
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,250
他们不知道做美国队长需要什么
They just do not know what it takes to be Captain America,

153
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,280
他们不知道
they just don't.

154
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,450
-我又不会消失  -好了  别乱
- It's not like I'm just gonna disappear. - Okay, focus.

155
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,390
一步步来
Take things one step at a time.

156
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,150
你先去见莱玛的父母
You start by visiting Lemar's parents.

157
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,860
他们需要见你  然后我们再...
They need to see you. And then, we can build...

158
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,200
这靴子可不适合走路
Well, these boots are not made for walkin'.

159
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,130
瓦伦蒂娜·爱兰格拉·德·芳汀
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

160
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,260
其实是康泰莎·瓦伦蒂娜·爱兰格拉·德·芳汀
Actually, it's Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

161
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,550
我知道不好记  但我不喜欢重复自己的话
I know it's hard, but I don't like to repeat myself,

162
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,190
所以你喊我小瓦就行
so you can just call me Val.

163
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,310
但别喊我小瓦  记住
But don't call me Val, just keep it in your head.

164
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,910
我...
I'm gonna...

165
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,300
听着
Look...

166
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,120
换我也会杀了那混蛋
I would have killed the bastard too.

167
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,890
里面没人为了这个气你
Nobody in there is mad at you about that.

168
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,650
如果你把他们都干掉
I mean, you would've been doin' 'em a favor

169
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,940
算是帮他们忙了
if you'd taken out the whole lot.

170
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,000
但这些打领带的家伙
But these guys in ties, you know,

171
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,380
他们要保护很多东西
they got a whole thing to protect.

172
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,760
不好意思  你是谁
Excuse me. Who are you?

173
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,270
反正  你做得对
Anyway, you did the right thing

174
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,330
注射血清
taking the serum.

175
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,900
我当然知道  我还要告诉你一件事
Yeah, of course I know about that. And I'll tell you something.

176
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,480
那让你对于某些人来说非常有价值
It has made you very, very valuable to certain people.

177
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,240
我其实觉得那是你人生中做过的
I actually think it was the second best choice

178
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
第二正确的选择
you've ever made in your life.

179
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,090
想知道第一正确的是什么吗
Oh, you wanna know what the first best choice was?

180
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,890
和娶了
Tied with marrying

181
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,140
我身边这位超美辣妹并列第一的选择
this fabulous firecracker sitting right next to me.

182
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,510
你好啊
How's it going?

183
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,460
就是我打给你的时候要接电话
Picking up the phone when I call you.

184
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,980
对了  别担心盾牌
Oh, by the way, don't worry about the shield.

185
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,520
我知道不在你手里
I know you don't have it.

186
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,400
告诉你一个不光彩的国家小秘密
Here's a little, dirty state secret.

187
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,810
盾牌其实根本不属于政府
It doesn't really belong to the government.

188
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,470
算是法律上的灰色地带
It's kind of a legal gray area.

189
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,270
我会联系你的
I'll be in touch.

190
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,950
上面什么也没写啊
There's... There's nothing on it.

191
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,110
{\an8}全球回归委员会

192
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,800
这上面说全球回归委员指控他们
It says here the GRC accused them

193
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,090
窝藏和教唆国际难民
of harboring and abetting international fugitives,

194
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,020
所以他们突袭了这里  把它关停了
so they raided the place and shut it down.

195
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,250
马赛厄斯
Mathias.

196
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,210
唐妮娅老师
Mama Donya.

197
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,260
尼柯
Nico.

198
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,440
我已经数不过来还有多少人了
I've lost count of how many others.

199
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,190
我们还得付出多少生命的代价
How many times do we have to pay with our lives

200
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,930
就为了做这个该死的星球上的合法公民
just to be citizens of this goddamn planet!

201
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,340
运动已经准备好了
The movement is ready.

202
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,980
他们不会停手的
They're not going to stop.

203
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,010
除非我们逼他们停下
Not unless we make them.

204
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,560
是时候了
It's time.

205
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,220
{\an8}索科威亚

206
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,860
没想到你这么慢
I thought you'd be here sooner.

207
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,710
别担心
Don't worry.

208
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,510
我已经决定了不会杀你
I've decided I'm not going to kill you.

209
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,030
我可真是松了口气
Imagine my relief.

210
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,220
那女孩已经走向了极端  没救了
The girl has been radicalized beyond salvation.

211
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,510
我警告过山姆  可他没听我的
I warned Sam, but he didn't listen to me.

212
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,820
他跟之前的史蒂夫·罗杰斯一样执拗
He's as stubborn as Steve Rogers before him.

213
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,230
但你不同
But you...

214
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,630
他们之前是真把你设置成了杀人机器
They literally programmed you to kill.

215
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,810
詹姆斯  做该做的事
James, do what needs to be done.

216
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,590
卡莉在各处都有人手
Karli has people everywhere,

217
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,210
只有一个办法
and there's only one way

218
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,110
能确保她无法继续她的使命
to make sure she cannot continue her mission.

219
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,130
感谢你的建议
I appreciate the advice.

220
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,510
但我们会按自己的方式来
But we're gonna do it our own way.

221
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,820
好吧
Yeah.

222
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,790
我就怕你会那么说
I was afraid you would say that.

223
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,870
女士们
Ladies...

224
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,490
我擅自从你的小本子上划去了我的名字
I took the liberty of crossing off my name in your book.

225
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,420
我对你认为你该做的事没有意见
I hold no grudges for what you thought you had to do.

226
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,540
再见  詹姆斯
Goodbye, James.

227
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,450
我们会带他去孤岛监狱
We will take him to the Raft...

228
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,200
他会在那里度过余生
Where he will live out his days.

229
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,870
眼下你最好
It would be prudent to make yourself scarce

230
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,680
暂时离瓦坎达远点  白狼
in Wakanda for the time being, White Wolf.

231
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,740
的确
Fair enough.

232
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,230
我可能还得请你帮个忙
I may have another favor to ask of you.

233
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,880
{\an8}马里兰州  巴尔的摩

234
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,450
来啊
Come on.

235
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,790
你干什么  你去哪
What you doing, man? Where you goin'?

236
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,470
我要见你爷爷
I'm goin' to see your grandfather.

237
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,460
好吧  他在家里
All right, he in the back.

238
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,240
谢了
Thanks.

239
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,330
-我一会就回去  -好
- I'll be back there. - Yeah.

240
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,900
来吧  哥们
Check up, man.

241
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,460
那是我想的那东西吗
That what I think it is?

242
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,250
别打开
Leave it covered.

243
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,780
星条对我来说绝非好事
Them stars and stripes don't mean nothin' good to me.

244
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,640
我不太明白
I need to understand.

245
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,590
你明白的
You understand.

246
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,740
每个黑人都明白
Every Black man does.

247
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,150
不管你想不想否认
Whether you wanna deny it or not...

248
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,270
别跟我来这套苦大仇深的老头子说教
Don't do that bitter, old man thing with me.

249
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,010
你感觉不到苦的话  说明你瞎
If you ain't bitter, you're blind.

250
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,870
我真的不懂  好吗
I don't get it, okay?

251
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,890
哪里出了错
What went wrong?

252
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,340
我曾经很像你
I used to be like you,

253
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,740
直到我睁开了眼睛
until I opened my eyes,

254
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,310
{\an8}二战时一支完全由黑人组成的陆军航空大队

255
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,310
直到我看见红色机尾战士
until I saw men in the Red Tails,

256
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,780
著名的332战斗机大队  为这个国家而战
the famous 332 fight for this country,

257
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,130
等他们凯旋
only to come home

258
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,900
却发现自家草坪上被人扔了燃烧的十字架
to find crosses burned on their lawn.

259
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,340
我在南方长大  这我懂
I'm from the south. I get that.

260
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,470
但你是像史蒂夫一样的超级士兵
But you were a Super Soldier like Steve.

261
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,590
你本可以成为下一个...
You could've been the next...

262
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,740
下一个什么
The next? What?

263
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,040
金发碧眼  星条装饰吗
Blonde hair, blue eyes, stars and stripes?

264
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,990
自从他打了血清
The entire world's been chasing that great white hope

265
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,870
全世界都追着那位白人希望之星
since he first got dosed with that serum.

266
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,800
不是史蒂夫害你坐牢的
Steve did not put you in jail.

267
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,290
我坐牢的时候她死了
She died while I was in jail.

268
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,220
她给我写的信全部被拦下了  我一封都没读到
They, uh, never let a single one of her letters get to me.

269
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,370
他们把信锁在这个盒子里
They locked 'em in this box.

270
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,250
他们告诉她  我死了
They told her I was dead.

271
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,110
过了一阵子
Yeah, and after a while, 

272
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,740
她去世了  然后...
she was gone, and, uh...

273
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,230
对不起
Sorry.

274
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,180
你问哪里出了错
You wanted to know what went wrong?

275
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,020
我们有几个人
A handful of us got shot up

276
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,460
被注射了不同版本的血清
with different versions of that serum,

277
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,430
但他们不告诉我们打的是什么
but they don't tell us what it is.

278
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,150
谎称那是破伤风疫苗
They tell us it's tetanus.

279
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,370
他们派我们出任务
They sent us on missions,

280
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,670
哪怕其他人状态并不稳定
even though the others weren't stable.

281
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,340
有些人开始死掉
Some of us started dying off.

282
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,510
有两个人在执行一项任务时被捕
Then a couple of the boys get captured on a mission.

283
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,470
我听到高层说
I heard the brass talkin' about

284
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,880
要把战俘营炸掉  隐藏证据
blowing the POW camp to hell to hide the evidence.

285
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,310
但他们是我的人  我的兄弟
But those were my men. My brothers.

286
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,050
他们不是证据
Not evidence.

287
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,060
所以有天夜里我逃出来了
So I bust out of the facility one night

288
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,520
把兄弟们带了回来
and I brought them boys back.

289
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,840
虽然这样做也是徒劳
Not that it made a damn bit of difference.

290
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,440
不久就只剩我一个了
It wasn't long before it was only me left.

291
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,340
我救了他们的命  但结果呢
And what did I get for saving their lives?

292
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,420
接下来的30年
For the next 30 years,

293
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,350
他们拿我做实验
they experimented on me,

294
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,390
想弄清为什么血清在我身上成功了
trying to figure out why the serum worked.

295
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,650
有个护士
There was a nurse.

296
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,810
她可怜我
She took pity on me.

297
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,800
伪造了一些报告
Wrote up some fake reports, something.

298
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,030
在她的帮助下  我被宣布死亡
She had me declared dead.

299
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,550
就是她把这盒子给了我
That's who gave me this.

300
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,840
天啊
My God!

301
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,250
山姆  我是如此爱她
Sam, I loved her so much.

302
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,670
布莱德利先生
Mr. Bradley, um...

303
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,140
我们得做点什么  我们得公开这件事
We gotta do something. We gotta tell somebody.

304
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,930
不  就让我继续做个死人吧
No. Leave me dead.

305
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,130
我的名字已被埋葬了
My name is buried.

306
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,210
但世界现在不一样了  我认识一些人
But the world's different now. I know people.

307
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,500
所以你今天才来的吗
Man, that's why you're here?

308
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,950
你以为时过境迁了吗
You think things are different? You think times are different?

309
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,570
你以为你公开我的身份之后  我能活过一天吗
You think I wouldn't be dead in a day if you brought me out?

310
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,230
你想相信  坐牢是我的错
You wanna believe jail was my fault

311
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,890
因为你拿到了那个白人的盾
because you got that white man's shield.

312
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,130
他们担心我的事迹会传出去
They were worried my story might get out.

313
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,290
所以他们把我抹掉了
So, they erased me.

314
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,800
我的过去
My history.

315
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,290
但这种事他们已经做了五百年
But they've been doing that for 500 years.

316
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,750
向那玩意宣誓效忠吧  兄弟
Pledge allegiance to that, my brother.

317
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,770
他们永远不会 
They will never 

318
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,140
让一个黑人当美国队长的
let a Black man be Captain America.

319
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,470
就算他们允许
And even if they did,

320
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,860
有自尊的黑人也绝不会当的
no self-respecting Black man would ever wanna be.

321
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,470
莎拉  我准备回家
Sarah, I'm comin' home.

322
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,330
干得漂亮  孩子们
Good job, guys.

323
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,440
大概只需要十年  我们就能补好了
In about 10 years, we'll have this thing fixed.

324
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,060
卖掉这条船之前  再驾着它出航一次
Would be fun to take the boat out one more time,

325
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,620
应该会很好玩
before we sell it?

326
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,770
格兰德岛上有个超棒的地方
There's a great spot in Grand Isle,

327
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,790
你们外公以前常带我去  抓了好多鱼
your grandfather used to take me, catch a lot of fish.

328
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,420
但妈妈说船卖不出去
But Mom said we can't sell it.

329
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,250
什么
What?

330
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,070
船况太差了
It's too messed up.

331
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,950
丁先生说他不想买  因为翻修比买船还贵
Mr. Dinh said he wouldn't buy it 'cause it cost more to fix.

332
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,710
然后他还说了几句越南语
And then he said something else in Vietnamese.

333
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,780
是啊
Yeah.

334
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,630
你之前怎么不说
Why didn't you say somethin'?

335
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,470
因为我昨晚不想告诉你
Because I didn't wanna tell you last night

336
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,530
你当时就像一只被雨淋湿的哀伤小狗
when you were lookin' all sad puppy dog in the rain.

337
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,840
昨天我很难受
It was a rough day.

338
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,620
因为去见了艾赛亚·布莱德利吗
You mean with Isaiah Bradley?

339
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,930
还有他们对他做的事
And what they did to him.

340
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,600
你想谈谈吗
You wanna talk about it?

341
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,760
不
No.

342
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,680
我想弄懂那一切的意义
I'm trying to figure out what it all means.

343
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,470
好吧  我随时都在
Okay, well, I'm here.

344
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,860
但说到这条船
But as far as the boat is concerned,

345
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,160
最主要是丁先生反悔了
the bottom line is, Mr. Dinh backed out.

346
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,850
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

347
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,730
修好了再卖
Parts alone on that thing

348
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,400
可能连维修成本都拿不回来
are gonna eat up most of what we get back.

349
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,860
听我说  别担心  我会修好船的
Listen to me. Don't worry. I'm gonna fix the boat.

350
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,900
你不是去拯救世界了吗
Aren't you supposed to be off saving the world?

351
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,380
为什么还回来烦我
Why are you back here bothering me?

352
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,010
因为我家人的幸福也是世界的一部分
'Cause my family's well-being is a part of the world.

353
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,890
你在等线索
So you're waiting for a lead?

354
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,020
然后政府插手了
And the government stepped in

355
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,490
夺走了控制权  让我们坐冷板凳
and took control and kind of benched us.

356
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,160
孩子们
Hey, guys.

357
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,760
记得给班尼特和艾林一人一个
Please make sure Bennett and Elling each get one.

358
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,040
-好吗  -好
- Okay? - Okay.

359
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,990
-好  再见  -再见
- All right. Bye. - Bye.

360
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,830
祝你们今天在学校开心  孩子们
Have a good day at school, guys.

361
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,880
好的
Okay.

362
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,980
班尼特和艾林的爸爸不到中午不起床
Bennett and Elling's dad cannot get up before noon.

363
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,030
孩子们一直都饿着肚子上学
Kids keep showing up hungry,

364
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,590
但碍于面子不肯开口求助
but are too proud to ask for any help.

365
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,150
你跟妈妈当年一样  喂饱这里每个孩子
And you're just like Mom, feeding every kid in the neighborhood.

366
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,350
有多少人还欠爸妈人情
How many people still owe Mom and Dad something?

367
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,620
所有人都欠
All of them.

368
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,820
当然是指所有还活着的人
All that's left, for sure.

369
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,400
可能是时候让他们还一还人情了
It might be time to call in a few of those favors.

370
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,200
我会修好这条船
I'm gonna fix this damn boat.

371
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,290
-我是山姆·威尔逊  -你好  山姆
- Hey, it's Sam Wilson. - Hi, Sam.

372
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,660
是啊  我是保罗的小儿子  我们住街那头
Yeah. Paul's youngest boy from up the street.

373
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,660
你姐姐最近怎么样
How's your sister?

374
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,050
帕蒂女士  你还记得我爸妈吗
Hey, Miss Paddy. You remember my mom and dad?

375
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,200
我记得
Yes, I remember.

376
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,070
猎鹰先生
Hey, Mr. Falcon.

377
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,220
你怎么样了  孩子
What's happenin' with you, boy?

378
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,360
我回家了  所以才给你打电话
I'm back in town, that's why I'm calling.

379
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,380
你需要什么
What you need?

380
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,810
{\an8}保罗和达琳号

381
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,010
-瑟罗先生  -怎么了
- Mr. Thurow. - Yes.

382
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,290
我能请你帮个忙吗
Any chance I can ask a favor?

383
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,100
为威尔逊家做什么我都乐意
Anything for the Wilson family.

384
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,010
-谢谢  -只要你有需要  我们一定会来
- Appreciate it. - We'll be there if you need us.

385
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,860
我不知道怎么才能把它搬出来
I don't know how we're gonna get it out.

386
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,700
我们还需要些人手
We need some more guys for this.

387
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,980
汤米  卡洛斯  你们太棒了
Tommy, Carlos, man, this is amazing.

388
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,180
非常感谢
Thanks so much, man. 

389
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,190
-真的谢谢你们  -听我说
- Thank y'all. - Hey, look,

390
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,710
威尔逊一家需要帮助的消息传开了
word goes out the Wilson family needs help?

391
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,210
没错
Yes, sir.

392
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,080
我们还是有点用处的
We still got a bit of usefulness in us.

393
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,960
我们怎么把它从卡车上弄下来
How do we get it off the truck?

394
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,690
不用谢
You're welcome.

395
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,560
我是来给你送这玩意的
Just dropping this off.

396
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,790
你签收了我就走
You can sign for it and I'll go.

397
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,720
我找瓦坎达人帮了个忙
I called in a favor from the Wakandans.

398
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,450
山姆
Sam!

399
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,170
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hi.

400
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,660
等一下  你应该向上扳
Hold on, hold on. You gotta go up.

401
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,250
你怎么不用金属手臂呢
Why didn't you use the metal arm?

402
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,090
我也不是每次都能立刻想起来
I don't always think of it immediately.

403
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,080
我是右撇子
I'm right-handed.

404
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,960
就是这艘船吗
So, this is the boat, huh?

405
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,770
就是它
This is it.

406
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,680
真不错
It's nice.

407
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,170
还需要帮忙吗
You want any help?

408
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,120
我是巴基
I'm Bucky.

409
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,070
我叫莎拉
Ah. Sarah.

410
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,920
莎拉
Sarah...

411
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,680
该死
Shit!

412
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,050
谢了
Thanks.

413
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,460
你觉得卡莉会认输吗
Think Karli's gonna throw in the towel?

414
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,040
我觉得她会更豁出去
I think she's gonna double down.

415
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,740
想到怎么阻止她了吗
Any idea how to stop her?

416
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,850
我让华金去查了
I got Joaquin working on something.

417
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,780
泽莫说只有一种方法
Well, Zemo says there's only one way.

418
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,860
我明天得赶飞机
Gotta catch my flight tomorrow.

419
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,000
今天先在旅馆住一晚
Get a hotel room for the night.

420
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,430
凑活一夜
Crash, you know?

421
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,580
你就想套我话呢是吧
You're just gonna set me up like that, huh?

422
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,630
我不想让你的家人感到奇怪
I don't wanna make it weird for your family.

423
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,160
住这里就好
Just stay here.

424
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,970
这个镇上的人
The people in this town

425
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,460
是全世界最热情的人
are the most welcoming people in the world.

426
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,070
他们才不管你穿的T恤是不是太紧身
They don't care if you wear small T-shirts

427
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,210
还是你有六个脚趾  或者你妈其实是你小姨
or if you have six toes or if your mom's your aunt.

428
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,520
行  我知道了
Okay, I get it.

429
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,350
这里的人都非常友好
I mean, you know, the people are nice.

430
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,320
但是别和我姐姐调情
But don't flirt with my sister.

431
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,950
-不会的  -你要是敢
- No. - 'Cause if you do,

432
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,790
我就叫卡洛斯把你切碎了扔到海里喂鱼
I'll have Carlos cut you up, feed you to fish.

433
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,890
好的
Okay.

434
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,040
然后呢
And then what?

435
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,120
我看到
After I saw what happened

436
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,750
莱玛的遭遇后
to Lemar,

437
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,430
就去追他了
I went after him.

438
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,270
那个男人
And, um, that guy...

439
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,760
就是他杀了我们儿子吗
He's the one that killed our boy?

440
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,750
是的
Yes.

441
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,400
我绝不会让凶手逍遥法外
I would never let the person who did that get away.

442
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,930
希望你们大仇得报之后能有所宽慰
And I hope you can find some measure of peace in that.

443
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,040
这张照片是我拍的
I took that.

444
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,480
当时我们刚结束第一次派驻回国
When we got back from our first tour.

445
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,010
没有人像他这么好
There was nobody like him.

446
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,370
莱玛知道其中的危险
Lemar knew the risk.

447
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,930
在你们一起经历了这么多之后
After everything you boys have been through together,

448
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,530
我知道  当他泉下有知
I know he's restin' easier

449
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:58,150
凶手罪有应得  他也会安息的
knowin' that the man who's responsible got his justice.

450
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,240
他们任你为美国队长时
He was so proud of you 

451
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,860
他很为你自豪
when they made you Captain America.

452
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,530
他每天都跟我说
And he would tell me every day,

453
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,310
做你的搭档有多么光荣
what an honor it was to be your partner.

454
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,630
这对他来说意义非凡
It meant the world to him.

455
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,090
对我来说也是
And for me too.

456
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,490
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

457
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,370
只要你们需要我  我一直都在你们身边
If you ever need me, I'm always here for you.

458
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,210
好了
Okay.

459
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:13,670
{\an8}约翰·沃克
队长回归

460
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,540
有个活儿要给你
I have a job for you.

461
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,890
拜托  要不是我
Please. If it weren't for me,

462
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,400
你还烂在阿尔及利亚的监狱里呢
you'd be rotting in that Algerian prison.

463
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,920
说完了吗
Finished?

464
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,810
这次我可以给你双倍
I can give you double this time.

465
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,940
我保证你答应了不会后悔
I promise you won't regret saying yes.

466
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,480
所以怎么说
So what's it gonna be?

467
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,290
放回去
Put it back.

468
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,010
快点  快点
Hurry, hurry!

469
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,070
按下阻断
Push the stopper.

470
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,680
这边
Oh, in there.

471
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,730
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thanks. - Yep.

472
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,370
拧松那些螺栓
Hey. Start loosening those bolts.

473
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,400
好的
Got it.

474
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,660
好了  那么...
Okay, so...

475
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,970
不好意思  不
Excuse me. No!

476
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,450
在大齿轮上
There should be a three-sixteenths bolt 

477
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,150
应该有一个3/16螺栓
that goes in the big gear.

478
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,410
-不  -不不不
- Nope. - Uh-huh. No. No.

479
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,050
-你都没看  -我不需要看
- You didn't even look. - I didn't have to.

480
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,280
你好  莎拉
Hi, Sarah.

481
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
我专门和你说过
I told you specifically 

482
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,830
问题不在水泵上
that the water pump was not the problem,

483
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,050
但你还是来了
and yet, here you are.

484
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,470
是啊  山姆
Yep, Samuel.

485
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,000
我要先声明
In our defense,

486
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,500
我们本来打算在你醒来之前就搞定的
we were supposed to be done long before you woke up.

487
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,510
我不会上天
I don't come up to the sky 

488
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,750
教你桶式翻滚
to tell you how to barrel roll,

489
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,960
所以你也别跑来
so don't come down here

490
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,710
瞎搞你不懂的东西
and mess around with things you don't understand.

491
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,060
再见  不送
Bye. Off.

492
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,020
谢谢两位先生
Thank you, gentlemen.

493
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,350
非常感激
Appreciate you.

494
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,580
我爱你  弟弟
I love you, bro.

495
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,200
她可真刻薄
She's a very mean person.

496
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,380
忠言逆耳罢了
It's tough love.

497
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,100
不  如果你照我说的做
No. If you did what I told you to do,

498
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,830
我们早就搞定了  不用挨骂
we would have been done before any of this took place.

499
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,400
没这回事
There is no such thing.

500
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,890
我的疯狂是有技术含量的
There's a prowess that goes into my madness.

501
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,560
感觉好怪
Feels weird...

502
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,850
再次拿起盾
Picking it up again.

503
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,530
这面盾牌的传承
The legacy of that shield

504
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,610
至少可以说是"十分复杂"
is complicated, to say the least.

505
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,970
史蒂夫告诉我他的计划时
When Steve told me what he was planning,

506
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,520
我们可能都不明白
I don't think we understood

507
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,650
作为一个黑人
what it felt like for a Black man 

508
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,100
被托付这面盾牌的感受
to be handed the shield.

509
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,690
我们怎么会理解呢
How could we?

510
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,110
我欠你一个道歉
I owe you an apology.

511
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,840
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

512
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

513
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,120
沃克的事不是你的错
Whatever happened with Walker, it wasn't your fault.

514
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,510
我明白
I get it.

515
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,230
只是  这面盾牌
It's just, that shield's

516
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,600
是我仅剩的  最接近家人的存在
the closest thing I've got left to a family,

517
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,880
所以你让它退役时
so when you retired it,

518
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,630
我觉得我失去了一切
it made me feel like I had nothing left.

519
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,530
我开始怀疑一切
Made me question everything.

520
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,070
你  史蒂夫  我自己
You, Steve, me.

521
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,520
我拿了...
You know, I've got his, uh...

522
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,930
我拿了他的本子
I've got his book.

523
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,200
然后...
And, uh...

524
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,100
我想着  如果这样做对他有帮助
I just figured if it worked for him,

525
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
那对我也会有帮助
then it'd work for me.

526
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,880
我明白
I understand, man.

527
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,420
但史蒂夫已经不在了
But Steve is gone.

528
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,320
你可能没这么想过
And this might be a surprise,

529
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,380
但其实史蒂夫的想法并不重要
but it doesn't matter what Steve thought.

530
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,260
你不该继续指望其他人
You gotta stop looking to other people 

531
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,960
来告诉你你到底是谁了
to tell you who you are.

532
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,910
我问你
Let me ask you.

533
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,980
你还会做那些噩梦吗
You still having those nightmares?

534
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,640
一直都会
All the time.

535
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,750
这说明我还记得
It means I remember.

536
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,040
说明有一部分我仍留在那里
It means a part of me is still there.

537
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,140
说明冬日战士仍残留在我心里
Which means a part of the Winter Soldier's still in me.

538
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,410
你愿意听逆耳忠言吗
You up for a little tough love?

539
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,540
你想爬出你身处的地狱
You want to climb out of the hell you're in,

540
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,380
那就努力
do the work.

541
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,620
去做
Do it.

542
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,850
我已经在赎罪补过了
I've been making amends.

543
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,390
不  你不是在补过  你只是在复仇
Nah. You weren't amending, you were avenging.

544
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,980
你阻止那些你当冬日战士时
You were stopping all the wrongdoers

545
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,180
所助长过的罪犯
you enabled as the Winter Soldier,

546
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,790
因为你觉得这样能给你带来解脱
because you thought it would bring you closure.

547
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,170
你去找这些人  去道歉
You go to these people and say "Sorry,"

548
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,090
因为你觉得这样会让你好受一些  对吗
because you think it'll make you feel better, right?

549
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,310
但是你应该让他们好受一些
But you gotta make them feel better.

550
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,990
你得找他们  去帮助他们
You gotta go to them and be of service.

551
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,560
我想这本子里至少有一个
I'm sure there's at least one person in that book

552
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,770
需要得到解脱的人
who needs closure about something,

553
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,240
只有你可以帮到那个人
and you're the only one who can give it to 'em.

554
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,290
很可能有十几个呢
Probably a dozen.

555
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,500
没关系
That's cool.

556
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,690
先从一个开始
Start with one.

557
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,830
你很会说
Good talk.

558
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,970
你知道卡莉不会罢手的
You know Karli won't quit.

559
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,030
你有线索就联系我  我马上到
You call me when you have a lead, and I'll be there.

560
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,460
-不一定以队友身份 -的确
- Not necessarily as a team. - Nope.

561
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,430
-我们关系没那么好  -的确没有
- We're not that good. - Definitely not.

562
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,290
-我们很专业的  -没错
- We're professionals. - Definitely.

563
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,610
-我们是搭档  -同事
- And, uh, we're partners. - Co-workers.

564
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,300
但我们也是两个有一名共同朋友的人
But we're also a couple of guys with a mutual friend.

565
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,360
-那朋友已经离开了  -那我们就是两个男的
- Friend's now gone. - So we're a couple of guys.

566
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,050
-这样也行  -很完美
- I can live with that. - Perfect.

567
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,330
谢谢你的帮助 
Thanks for the help, man.

568
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,680
对我很重要
Meant a lot.

569
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,210
不客气
Of course.

570
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,160
只剩下最后一件事要做了
There's only one last thing to do.

571
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,660
看起来很不错
Looks good.

572
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,180
住手  不要
Stop. Don't.

573
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,250
{\an8} 保罗和达琳号

574
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,420
我们不能卖掉
We can't sell it.

575
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,110
我知道你要说什么  不明智  但是...
I know. I know the speech. It's not smart, but...

576
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,170
我就是做不到
I just can't.

577
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,530
莎拉  听到你这么说  我很高兴
Sarah, I'm so happy to hear you say that.

578
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,790
我们必须留下这艘船
We have to preserve this.

579
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,690
要说我到现在学到了什么
If there's one thing I've learned,

580
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,810
那就是  我不可能赢下每一场仗
it's that I can't win every fight.

581
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,350
没关系  我已经接受了  但这个...
That's cool. I'm okay with that. But this...

582
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,630
这是我们共同的历史
This is our history.

583
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,360
我们不能输掉这场仗
We can't lose this fight.

584
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,310
我每每想到我们作为普通人
All our struggles as a people,

585
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,040
做出的种种挣扎  我以前经常会说
I think about it and I used to say,

586
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,080
"我要给他们看看  我要去改变世界"
"I'mma show them. I'mma go out and change the world."

587
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,230
我知道很傻
Yeah, silly, I know,

588
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,790
但是当我看着你的眼睛
but when I'd look in your eyes,

589
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,080
我能看出你一直觉得我在逃避
I could tell you were always thinking that I was runnin' away.

590
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,650
山姆  听我说
Sam, listen to me.

591
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,510
我这辈子从来没觉得你在逃避
At no point in my life did I ever think you were runnin' away.

592
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,630
逃避任何事
From anything.

593
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,440
即使我在银行指责你时也没那么想
Not even when I was lightin' yo ass up at the bank.

594
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,210
谁能想到你居然这么敏感
Who knew you were so sensitive.

595
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,230
老天  我好想念你
God, I missed you so much.

596
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,130
远方有一场战斗  我们也在这为生存为战
There's a fight out there, and then, there's our fight here,

597
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,480
弟弟  这两个重任你都扛起来了
and, bro, you have taken them both on.

598
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,500
你真要让艾赛亚·布莱德利影响到你吗
So you really gonna let Isaiah Bradley get in your head?

599
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,160
你要让他决定你接下来该做什么吗
You gonna let him decide what you do next?

600
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,400
艾赛亚受尽折磨
Isaiah has been to hell and back.

601
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,700
换作我是他  我也会有相同感受
If I was in his shoes, I'd feel the exact same way.

602
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,950
但如果我没有站起来继续战斗的决心
But what would be the point of all the pain and sacrifice

603
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,490
那些痛苦和牺牲又有什么意义
if I wasn't willing to stand up and keep fightin'?

604
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,460
一整天  孩子
All day, baby.

605
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,800
-山姆舅舅  -山姆舅舅
- Uncle Sam! - Uncle Sam!

606
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,230
抓住他  AJ
Get him, AJ!

607
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,690
这是在干什么
What are we doin' here?

608
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,690
我找了帮手  增加胜算
I got some help to even out the odds.

609
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,500
山姆不久前敲了他一笔巨款
Sam screwed him out of a small fortune not long ago.

610
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,600
从那以后他就一直渴望着复仇
He's been dying to get payback ever since.

611
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,580
你们好
Bonjour.

612
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,890
{\an2}你要的东西我带来了

613
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,390
你看
Voila.

614
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,450
不是吧
Come on.

615
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,820
我们现在和罪犯合作了吗
So we're working with criminals now?

616
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,210
你还没听说吗
Haven't you heard?

617
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,070
我们就是罪犯
We are criminals.

618
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
乔治得以复仇  我们则能抓到凶手
George gets his payback and we get a killer.

619
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,720
这笔交易对双方都有利
It's a bargain on both sides.

620
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,330
你邀请我来野餐的吗
You invite me here for a picnic or what?

621
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,620
{\an2}来进行一场测试

622
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,780
{\an2}我们无处不在  又无处可寻

623
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,280
{\an2}所以我们会赢

624
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,510
我们要破坏全球回归委员会的投票
We're gonna make sure the GRC vote never happens.

625
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,280
{\an2}我不是来参与你的运动的

626
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,530
我只是来杀猎鹰的
I'm only here to kill the Falcon.

627
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:38,760
你会得到机会
You'll get your chance.

628
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,590
今晚  我们开战
Tonight, we go to battle.

629
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,750
我们所有人
All of us.

630
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,600
全球回归委员会正在纽约
In New York, where the GRC

631
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:07,650
就富有争议的《补丁法》进行投票
is voting on the controversial Patch Act,

632
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:10,330
此法案会让超过两千万难民
which would move upwards of twenty million refugees

633
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,550
回到他们的祖国
back home to their countries of origin.

634
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,330
这即将发生  同时国际政治正处于艰难时期
It's coming during these difficult times of international politics.

635
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,720
抱歉花了那么久  我就不跟你扯技术细节了
Sorry this took so long. Spare you the technical details,

636
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,430
不过我终于拿到你要的扫描结果了
but I finally got results for the scans you asked for,

637
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,850
我认为我们有重大发现
and I think we're onto something.

638
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,690
回过头看能发现  发出这些
When we look back, all these pings,

639
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,350
脉冲信号的地方  之后都被碎旗者袭击了
they're from places just before the Flag Smashers hit,

640
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,200
显然  他们遍布全欧洲
clearly, they're all over Europe.

641
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,280
今天早些时候  纽约也出现了信号
Earlier today, we got one from New York.

642
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,070
我不能保证他们没用虚拟网络
Now, I can't promise you they're not using a VPN

643
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,770
或者没隐蔽位置  但是
or masking their location, but...

644
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,960
做得很好  华金
Great work, Joaquin.

645
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,600
接下来交给我
I'll take it from here.

646
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,320
{\an8}纽约

647
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,480
目标人群会配合的
Look, the right people will go along with this,

648
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,710
一向如此
they always do...

649
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,680
你必须考虑舆论
You have to consider the optics.

650
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,090
不  舆论就是我们给大众看到的
No, the optics are whatever we show them.

651
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:55,160
人们相信我们在做的事  才会支持我们
People have to believe in what we're doing to support us.

652
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,600
我们真有必要浪费时间投票吗
Do we really need to bother with a vote?

653
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,330
军队已就位
There are troops in place.

654
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,750
我现在打一通电话就能让难民转移
I can make a call and have the refugees move now.

655
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,090
我们不能把他们当牲口一样赶到一块
We're not rounding them up like cattle.

656
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,530
而且我们在安置营仍然没有
And we still do not have sufficient resources

657
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,390
足够的资源
in the resettlement camps.

658
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:15,880
多少才叫足够
What's sufficient?

659
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,960
他们不能永远留在那里
They can't stay where they are forever.

660
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,670
-同一世界  -同一类人
- One world. - One people.
